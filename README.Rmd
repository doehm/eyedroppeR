# eyedroppeR <img src='dev/images/hex-amatic.jpg' align="right" height="240" />

There are fancy ways to extract colours from images but sometimes it's easier if you could simply click on the image and choose the colours you want.

With `eyedroppeR` you can click on the image and it will return the hex codes of the selected pixel all within R.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("doehm/eyedroppeR")
```

Edit: I've removed the dependency on `ggchicklet` since it's not on CRAN

You may also need to install [`ggchicklet`](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/ggchicklet)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggchicklet", repos = "https://cinc.rud.is")
```


## Usage

Use `eyedropper` with the following steps:

1. Find the image you want to pick colours from online.
2. Right-click and 'copy image address'.

    2.a As an example copy the following link to the clipboard (right-click > copy image address).
    
    <img src='https://colorpalettes.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cvetovaya-palitra-1781.png' />

3. Choose how many colours to pick e.g. `n = 5`.
4. Run `pal <- eyedropper(n = 5)`. 
    
    4.a. `eyedropper` will read the copied address from the clipboard. Note: This will only work on Windows machines. For other OS' you'll just need to paste the URL in manually to `img_path` argument.
    
    4.b. If you have a local file or a saved `path` you can reference it directly with 
    `pal <- eyedropper(n = 5, img_path = path)`
    
5. Click the 5 desired colours. The image will be stretched to the borders of the window, but that's OK.
6. Done! Copy the returned string and add it to your script and start using `pal`.

## Other functions

* `sort_pal`: Allows you to manually sort a palette by clicking on the colours in order. It also allows you to select a specified number of colours if you don't want them all.

* `extract_pal`: Automatically selects a specified number of colours using a clustering algorithm. It will read the image path from the clipboard as well and allow you to sort the colours after they are extracted.

* `show_pal`: Simple helper to display the palette.
